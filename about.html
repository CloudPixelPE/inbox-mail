      <p class="question">What is an email alias? How is it different than a new email address?</p>
      <p class="answer">Email aliases are fake email addresses that can be used like just real email addresses.

      <p class="question">Doesn't using unique passwords solve the problem that Pseudoname addresses?</p>
      <p class="answer">Using unique passwords certaintly helps, however it does not fully solve the issue. Security experts agree that each user account should use unique emails and passwords.</p>
      <p class="question">What does it cost?</p>
      <p class="answer">Pseudoname was built to be a free service, however, due to high demand (and the server costs associated with running the site), we must now charge $1 per each email alias. We understand that this is not ideal and are currently looking for other sources of funding.</p>
